# Summary
### This project determined the growth of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the United States and the rest of the world. The provided data also determined which states and cities would be the best to invest in for EVs and charging stations. The final conclusion shows how the United States compares to the rest of the world in EV sales and then which states and cities are in demand for EVs and charging stations.

# Business Problem
### A client company wants to determine if investment in electric vehicle charging stations make sense throughout the United States. Your boss has tasked you with researching data on electric vehicles throughout the United States in order to 1) Recommend for or against investment, and 2) Make specific recommendations on location, type, rates, etc.

# Data
### There were multiple different data sets used for this project. The data sets are all located in the [Data Folder](https://github.com/Loehnert12/Activities/tree/main/Data) of this repository.

# Methods
### The methods used in this project started in Python. Excel files were brought into Python where they were cleaned and sorted through to pull specific information needed to determine the questions. Once Python was used to clean, the data was then pulled into SQL. SQL was then used to sort through specific data breaking it down into states, population, ratios, etc. Once SQL was used to determine the correct data needed, the data was then put into Tableau to better visualize and answer the questions.

# Results
### Determine the current state and potential growth of the EV market in the U.S.:
	- Is investment in EVs increasing?
	- How does the US compare to the rest of the world?

###  Identify key areas or regions where EV charging infrastructure is lacking or in high demand:
        - What State to invest in? Why?
        - What State to AVOID investing in? Why?
        - What city to invest in? Why?
        - What city to AVOID investing in? Why?

# Conclusions
### Through the multiple different data sets provided, the overall investment in EVs is increasing not only in the United States, but the world as well. If a company is looking into placing more charging stations for EVs, California will be the best state for that. California has the highest EV to motor vehicle ratio, therefore, is in higher demand for charging stations. There are multiple cities in extreme demand for charging stations based off the amount of EVs per capita.
